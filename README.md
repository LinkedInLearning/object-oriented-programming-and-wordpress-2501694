![Object-Oriented Programming and WordPress][lil-thumbnail-url] 

Object-oriented programming is ideal in large, complex, and continually maintained projects. It lets you take a huge problem and break it down into solvable chunks. In this course, Gary Kovar covers the benefits of OOP, answers “Why OOP in WordPress?” and how to best connect with WordPress. Gary takes you through a refresher on OOP PHP syntax, takes a deep look at architecture concepts, shows you what OOP is not good for, simple wins with OOP, and team benefits. He also provides multiple real-world examples of OOP and WordPress—including building a plugin using what you’ve learned in the course. If you have some experience with OOP—and some frustration—check out this course to learn how you can use it to your benefit when creating WordPress plugins.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
